# HM Land Registry Extractor
__part of: Property Wizard__  
__last update: 16 August 2017__

This program is an extractor of the HM Land Registry public data.  
The extracted data are stored for a successive use by the Property Wizard API.  
It is a Python script that run on scheduled times.


# How it works

The program can elaborate Price Paid Data CSV file obtained from HM Land Property.   
Thew process start with a call to main.py passing the CSV file to read.  
The CSV file is parsed and raw data is stored in the database.  
A second step is the extrapolation of custom data from the raw data and a new saving in the database.
The new data contains relevant data. The Address is composed using raw data fields.  
A partial post code is extracted (district) to be used a search key.  

Data contains a property ("action") which is still not clear how should be used.    
It indicates that the record can be a deletion or a change of previous one.  
It is also not clear what is the unique identifier of records (if exists).

## Note
Some prices seems wrong. For example 1Â£ or 125 million of pounds.  
The second case could be an error inserting the value with a wrong decimal character resulting 100 times more, so it could be 1million, and it is possible compared to other apartment in the same building.
