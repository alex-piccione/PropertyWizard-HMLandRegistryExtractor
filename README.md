# HM Land Registry Extractor
__part of: Property Wizard__  
__last update: 16 August 2017__

This program is an extractor of the HM Land Registry public data.  
The extracted data are stored for a successive use by the Property Wizard API.  
It is a Python script that run on scheduled times.


# How it works

The program can elaborate Price Paid Data CSV file obtained from HM Land Property.   
Thew process start with a call to main.py passing the CSV file to read.  
The CSV file is parsed and raw data is stored in the database (MongoDB).  
In a second step custom data is generated from the raw data and saved in a new position in the database.
The new data contains only relevant data from the source and processed information. The Address is composed using raw data fields.   
Partial post code is extracted (district) to be used a search key.  

Original records from HM Land Registry contains a field ("action") which is still not clear how should be used.    
It indicates that the record can be new or a deletion or a change of previous one.  
It is also not clear what is the unique identifier of records (if there is one).   

The process can be execute against a file that contains the same data multiple times (it is idempotent) ?
How to recognize that a file is already elaborated and eventually force a new elaboration?
The process can retrieve the file itself?

## Note
Some prices seems wrong. For example 1Â£ or 125 million of pounds.  
The second case could be an error inserting the value with a wrong decimal character resulting 100 times more, so it could be 1million, and it is possible compared to other apartment in the same building.
